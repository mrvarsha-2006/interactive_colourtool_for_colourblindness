# interactive_colourtool_for_colourblindness
An assistive tool built using Arduino Uno and TCS3200 Colour Sensor to help colour-blind individuals detect and identify colours in real-time. The system displays the name of the detected colour on a 16x2 LCD, making daily tasks like choosing clothes or reading labels easier for users with Colour Vision Deficiency.
